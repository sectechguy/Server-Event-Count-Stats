# Connector-Event-Count-Stats
The initial python script pulls the yesterdays connection statistics and compare it to the previous weeks worth of events.  The upper and lower confidence is derived to determine if yesterdays statistics are in line with the average.  A visualization is included using an R Shiny Application with plotly graphs.
